# alfred-change-case
> A simple Alfred workflow to change the case of the clipboard text.

## Installation

Pretty simple - just download the Alfred Workflow, and open to import!

**Note:** Requires nodejs be installed on your computer.

## Usage
Type `case` in the Alfred window, and choose the case you want to use. The original clipboard text will be overwritten with the same text in the new case.

## Credits

-  `titlecase` is used for—wait for it—the title case. Rather than just capitalizing all words, it conforms to standard English title case usage for articles, etc.

-  Lodash is used for all other cases.

-  Alfy is used to install via npm.
